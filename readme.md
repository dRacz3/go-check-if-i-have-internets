# Check if I have internets

I find it quite annoying when I have internet problems.
This tool will help you to check if you have internet, and log the result of every check.
Also, this is my first go project, so there are some bugs and missing features such as log rotation in sqlite,
make sure you have enough disk to backup this ever growing file.


You can run it with 5 sec polling time like this:
```
go run . -t 5
```
